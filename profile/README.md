The [InnerSource Commons](https://innersourcecommons.org) Foundation is the world's largest community of InnerSource practitioners. 
It is dedicated to creating and sharing knowledge about InnerSource, the use of open source best practices for software development within the confines of an organization.

## InnerSource Commons on GitHub

In this GitHub org we keep all assets that the InnerSource Commons produces to help others to learn more about InnerSource.
It also contains repositories used for the operation of the Foundation itself.
